# TLP : Template Programming Package in C++11!

***

## Introduction

TLP is a C\++ template programming package including below:

- Compile-time base type `NullType`, `EmptyType`, `IntType`, `BoolType` and algorithms on them;

- Compile-time data structure `TypeList`;

- Base algorithms on `TypeList` such as  `Length`, `Append`, `Erase`, `Replace`, `Unique`...

- Advanced algorithms on `TypeList` such as  `Any`, `All`, `Filter`, `Map`, `Fold`, `Sort`...

- Template meta programming utils such as `IsEqual`, `IfThenElse`, `Print`...

- Useful traits tools such as `IsConvertible`, `IsBaseOf` and several lambda traits toolsï¼›

- Tools for simplify defination of compile-time meta functions;

- Samples for using TLP:
    - Pure compile-time computing for counting triangles.
	- Gof visitor design pattern generated by TLP.
	- A DSL for implementation of state machine in table format.
	
- **A pure compile-time test framework for C\++ template meta programming;**

## Install and Test

### Get TLP

~~~ bash
git clone git@github.com:magicbowen/tlp.git
~~~

### Install TLP

~~~bash
cd tlp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
~~~

### Test TLP

Tlp use its own test framework for testing.

Just compile the testcases for testing. If all tests are compiled ok, it means that all tests passed.

~~~ bash
cd tlp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DENABLE_TEST=1 ..
make
./test/tlp-test
~~~

### Run Samples

Samples include examples for how to using TLP.

Compile and run all the samples:

~~~ bash
cd tlp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DENABLE_SAMPLE=1 ..
make
./samples/triangle/triangle
./samples/fsm/fsm
./samples/visitor/visitor
~~~
